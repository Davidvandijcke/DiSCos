\title{Function for computing barycenters in the DiSCo method at every time period}
\usage{
DiSCo_bc(controls.q, weights, evgrid = seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 101))
}
\arguments{
\item{controls.q}{List with matrices of control quantile functions}

\item{weights}{Vector of optimal synthetic control weights, computed using the DiSCo_weights_reg function.}

\item{evgrid}{Optional vector containing an evenly spaced grid on \link{0,1} on which the quantile function for the control units will be evaluated
By default, a grid of 100 points is used.}
}
\value{
The quantile function of the barycenter associated with the "weights" evaluated at the vector "evgrid"
}
